# Springboard.com Data Science Program

This Github repository contains the coursework completed in the [Springboard data science online bootcamp](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track/).  The program covers data science topics including machine learning, inferential statistics and data storytelling.  Two capstone projects were completed with the guidance of a data science mentor.

## Data wrangling

Working with messy raw data: extraction, cleaning, and dealing with missing, invalid or corrupted values.

### Working with data in files

Used Pandas and other Python packages for data wrangling operations.

* [JSON based data exercises](https://github.com/vincelaird/springboard/blob/master/data_wrangling_json/sliderule_dsi_json_exercise.ipynb) - Convert JSON from file into dataframe and review
* [XML based data exercises](https://github.com/vincelaird/springboard/blob/master/data_wrangling_xml/sliderule_dsi_xml_exercise.ipynb) - Parse XML from file into dataframe and review

### Working with data in databases

Utilized relational and nonrelational databases to attain and analyze data.

* [Mode Analytics: Drop in user engagement](https://modeanalytics.com/vincelaird/reports/fbf0fd3327dd/runs/23fa4c90a7d2) - Solution to the SQL Analytics training: [Investigating a Drop in User Engagement](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement/)

## Data storytelling

Telling stories with data, including exploration, communication and presentation.

### Telling the story of odds changes in MLB games, April 2016

* [Capstone project: MLB odds changes](https://github.com/vincelaird/springboard/blob/master/capstone/Data%20story.ipynb) - Data story of changes in odds leading up to contest start time of MLB games in April 2016

## Inferential statistics

### Exploratory data analysis projects

placeholder

* [Human body temperature](https://github.com/vincelaird/springboard/blob/master/human_temp/sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_1.ipynb) - analysis of human body temperatures and the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.
* [Racial discrimination](https://github.com/vincelaird/springboard/blob/master/racial_disc/sliderule_dsi_inferential_statistics_exercise_2.ipynb) - analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.
* [Reduction in hospital readmissions]() -
